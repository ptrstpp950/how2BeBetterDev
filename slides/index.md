How to be a better developer based on my (and friends) experience


<aside class="notes">
    Good Morning Wroc≈Çaw! Welcome to my session. Today I will present my own career in IT industry.

    But we start I would like to ask you for forgiveness. As you can hear I have a "strange" English accent. People say that is an east side accent. East side of a Moscow. I'm a bit disabled person, I have problems with hearing and I really try to make it better.

    So if you think you cannot stand it for 45 minutes, don't worry just put on your headphones or check session in second don't fell guilty.

    Anyway in normal sessions there is a one slide about a speaker, but today there will be a whole session about me. My name is Piotr Stapp and welcome to my world.
