The bridge on the screen is near Lvow in Ukraine and I suspect, because all the papers were destroyed during second world war and Soviet times. My grandmother told me about this bridge and there were a memorial board with his name on one of the pillars. I have to go there and check it myself.

But why am I saying this? The great honor for my great grandfather was to be the first person in the first train who cross the river using this bridge. How many of us are the first users of our own software? Don't be shy raise your hands. How many of us are users of software created by ourself? Please put your hands in the air. For a long time I was such person. When I was creating mBank I was using it everday and I fixed some bugs just because they were irritating me.
