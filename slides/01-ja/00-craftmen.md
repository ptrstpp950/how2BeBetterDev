## Craftsmanship

Craftsmanship. I hate this world in context of IT industry. Why are we proud of being craftsmans?
Shouldn't we be a bunch of great engeeniers or experts?

In old times a craftsman was a baker, a butcher, a shoemaker. Two of my grand-grandparents were craftmans a butcher and a baker. My grandfather was a baker. And I still remember when I was 5 or 6 the smell of a baking bread and the taste of it. But also I remember his worlds: every time you bake a bread you cannot be sure that it will be great, before you touch it and smell it.

I know in creating software it is same. You don't know if it is good or bad unless you run it on production for the first time and real users try it.
